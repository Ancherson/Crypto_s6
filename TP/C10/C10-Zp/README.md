# How to execute the java code

In order to execute the code, you first need to cd in TP/C10/C10-Zp folder.
Then execute

```bash
    ./run.sh <number>
```

with number the degree of the polynomial.

NB : It seems that 11 is the maximum BigInteger that the program can handle, while regular integers can only handle 7.
